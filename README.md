Media Through Time is an interactive website for users to explore and time-travel through the past, present and future of digital media. This website is an immersive and playful experience with three floating memory bubbles that the user can interact with. Each bubble opens a unique page with different aesthetics encapsulating the feeling of each era.

I wanted the website to be entertaining and intriguing, therefore I incorporated multiple GIFs, colours, external links and so on to create an engaging atmosphere. 

Page 1 is an illustration the past, specifically old media, with grainy textures and an interactive image that takes users to a website where old televisions are available for purchase. This showcases how we have evolved so much that old digital media is not easily accessible and individuals have to seek to find it. I also decided not to include a back button on this page to be a symbol of how individuals can't go back in time or alter the past, so in order to go back to the home page, users must press the backwards arrow on the top left of their screen, this gets them to interact with a majority of the screen.

Page 2 is a portrayal of the present media and current era we are living in. This page presents more of a cleaner more polished look with mixed languages (English and Farsi) to illustrate how media nowadays has become more personal, global and a part of people's identities. I added an image of modern day smartphones and added a hover effect to enlarge the image to illustrate how media is very out there and taking over everyone's lives.

Page 3 is a representation of media in the future and how it is unpredictable. This page includes glitch animations, unusual glitch GIF background and cluttered text, which signifies the uncertainty of where digital media could go.

Overall, this project was established entirely by HTML and CSS. This meant that although the website came out how I envisioned it, there were a few setbacks due to the limitations. For instance, I wanted to add a camera function on the present page so that users could see themselves when they clicked onto present media to illustrate that this is the era of time they are at. However, this didn't work because this could only be done using JavaScript, but this project was strictly CSS. Another challenge I faced was my original idea of bubbles popping, for example when a user clicks on a bubble, the bubble makes a popping sound. Furthermore, on the future media page I wanted to layer glitchy GIFs in the background, although this wasn't cooperating so I just resulted to one GIF for the background.

Additionally, in order to advance the development of my web-art project and to solve some visual/layout challenges, I used the resource w3schools.com to help me understand certain CSS functions such as linear-gradient backgrounds and box-shadow effects.

There were a few case studies that influenced my work and I was especially inspired by early net art that explores technology, memory and communication with elements of interactivity that will support my motive of illustrating how media evolves over time. 

For example, "Olia Lialina 1996, My Boyfriend Came Back from the War” as it represents the early era of experimenting with digital media through its nostalgic and emotional storytelling unfolded in the form of interaction. "Lorna Mills 2010s, Image Dump" for the visuals and the chaos created by GIFs to portray how media is fast paced and rapidly developing, "JODI 1996, wwwwwwwww.jodi.org" for its glitches and codes which is a symbol of the unknown and what digital media can become.

If I had more time or resources I would elaborate this web-art project by adding the bubble popping sound, perhaps creating more eras to make the website more dynamic, additional glitches on the future page and lastly transitions or animations between each page. 

The assests I created consists of: 
Each HTML page, style.css, the bubbles and animations, texts, cropping or changing the sizes of images.

For external assets, I conducted individual research and found these websites by myself.
